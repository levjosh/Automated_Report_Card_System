# The Automated Report Card System
This project is built to take information regarding students' grades and enter them into a formulated JSON format. This makes it easier for front-end web developers to take report card information and post it online to a website such as D2L.

## To-do List
- Create acceptance tests (make sure incoming information is valid).
- Adjust it so it can be run through command line
- Create a unit testing file
